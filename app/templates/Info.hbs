			The scientific and industrial communities are being confronted with a strong increase of Earth Observation
			(EO) satellite missions and related data. This is in particular the case for the atmospheric sciences
			communities, with the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite as well as upcoming Sentinel-5, -4, and
			scientific satellites ADM-Aeolus and EarthCARE. The challenge is not only to manage
			the large volume of data generated by each mission / sensor, but also to allow users to analyse the data
			streams in near-real-time and for long-term monitoring tasks. Creating synergies among the different dataset
			will be the key to exploit the full potential of the available information. TOP has the twofold aim of
			-based products, numerical
			model output, and ground measurements) can be simultaneously exploited by users (mainly scientists), and
			(2) a fully Virtual Research Environment (VRE) that allows avoiding the download of all data locally, and
			retrieving only the processing results is the optimal solution.
