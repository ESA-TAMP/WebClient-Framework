    <h1>Hi there, </h1>
    <p>great you find some time to look at <a href="http://eox.at">EOX</a>' entries to the <a href="http://2013.foss4g.org/programme/opening-up-the-map/"><em>Opening up the Map</em></a> challenge of the <a href="http://2013.foss4g.org/">FOSS4G 2013</a>. This map is our contribution to the <em>Best Open Source Software Integration</em> challenge.</p>
    <p>Scroll down to explore the highlights of our map. Note that it is optimized for Chrome particularly the time slider.</p>
    <p>Exclusively Open Source web mapping client &amp; server tools are combined for visualizing satellite image time series.</p>

    <h2>Layer Selection</h2>
    <p>The Layer/Product Widget allows activating and deactivating the configured products, which are then visualized in the different viewers.</p>
    <p>You can move the widget to another position by clicking and dragging on its header, give that a try.</p>
    <p>The Widget shows base layers (e.g. Terrain and Blue Marble), overlay layers (e.g. Streets) and product layer.  </p>
    <p>It is possible to sort the layers by clicking and dragging on the two triangle symbol.</p>
    <p>Transparency can be set by slider that appears by clicking on the circle icon of the product.</p>

    <p>Did you notice the <strong>time slider</strong> at the bottom of the page? We already selected September 29th, 2011 for you.</p>
    <p>Try stretching the time interval at its ends or draw a new one and watch the satellite images adjusting. Only those acquired within the selected interval are displayed.</p>
    <p>Note that only the latest 100 satellite images are shown per tile. Thus when selecting a big time interval you might not see all images available.</p>
    <p>By the way, try the scroll wheel to uncover additional functionality.</p>

    <p>Why is the time slider gone? We switched layers for you. To get it back, take a look at the layer switcher in the top right.</p>

    <h2>Let's go skiing!</h2>
    <p>And if you want to join us in winter, you'll probably find us skiing in the Alps. Maybe Innsbruck.</p>
    <p>Maybe together with the MapBox folks, invited as reward for the <a href="http://www.mapbox.com/tutorial-sherlock/" target="_blank">idea and code snippets we borrowed</a>.</p>
    <p>Interested in how the Alps look like in a Terrain Layer? Switch to the <a href="./terrain.html">Terrain Layer demo</a>.</p>
